## üöÄ Our Vision

We are building Abyss Tool from the ground up to help players save time, reduce repetitive strain, and enhance their overall gameplay experience. Our core principles are:

* **User-Friendly:** A simple interface with no steep learning curve.
* **Highly Customizable:** Easily adapt the tool to your personal playstyle and specific needs.
* **Efficient and Reliable:** Optimized for seamless performance with the target game.

## üóìÔ∏è Current Status

We are currently in the **pre-development** phase. This stage is focused on laying a strong foundation for the project. Our current activities include:

* **Feature Planning:** Defining the complete set of functionalities for the tool.
* **Interface Mockups:** Designing a clean and intuitive user experience.
* **Logic Design:** Creating the architecture for the core automation engine.
* **ML Training:** Developing initial object detection models using **Roboflow**.

There is no functional or playable version available yet. All development will be conducted transparently and in public on this repository.
