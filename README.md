## 🚀 Vision

Abyss Tool is being designed from the ground up to help players save time, reduce repetitive input fatigue, and focus on the parts of gameplay that matter most.  

We aim to deliver a tool that is:
- **User-friendly** — no steep learning curve.
- **Highly customizable** — adapt it to your personal playstyle.
- **Efficient and reliable** — optimized to work seamlessly with the target game.

## 📅 Current Status

We are in the **pre-development** stage:
- Feature set planning
- Interface mockups
- Automation logic design
- Training initial detection models with **Roboflow**

No playable or functional version is available yet. All development will take place **in public** on this repository so backers can follow along.
